I used to be a computer scientist and I was working as senior
developer, and database administrator at Infineon Technologies for six
years. Then I decide to completly change the field and become an
astrophysicist. I thought I would use computers just as tool and
programs like IDL, Matlab, Mathematica allow me to focus on my
scientific goals. During my bachelor/diploma thesis I discovered
wonderful world of Data Mining and I have realized (not without pain)
what difference software engineering skills could have. Particularly
those normally ignored by scientist such are revision control, UN*X
skills, TDD approach, etc. Linux and Python is the reason I'd like
computer science again. It seems to me that python is not just another
language as it is clear from it's massive adaptation between
scientist. It's not only practical but also elegant beautiful. Very
important aspect is that is free but not


Your schools match perfectly topics I'm extremely interested. The best
advantage compared to on-line materials I see the opportunity to
discuss experiences and problems with other students and instructors.


This
was wrong. During my internship at CERN I saw many briliant physisist
stucks by computer related problems. Some of them  .I have realized  that today science and
astrophysics in particular is flooded by data and therefore penetrated
by Compture Sciences. It's so essential as mathematics. But

But finally I realized


It seems that scienceist are disapointed from commercial tools like IDL,
Mathematica, Matblab, etc.

But the best thing about python (in my opinion) the potencial to 

We as scinentist have it learn fair part of Computer Scinece nad
Software Engeniiring to be able to focus on our scintific problems.

As a astrophysicist with background in Computer Science (finished CS
and physics studies, 6 years as senior developer and Oracle
DBA at Infineon Technologies) I understand the importance of Software
engineering skills such are version control, TDD approach, etc.




On one side there are many attempts to provide scientists

* 2 ways
* IDL, Matlab, LabView, Mathematica, etc.
* Software Engineering

Although first option
